One of the new features added in Java 7 is the capability to switch on a String.
The switch statement when used with a String uses the equals() method to compare the given expression to
each value in the case statement and is therefore case-sensitive and will throw a NullPointerException if the expression is null.

Previous Version:

String color = "red";  
      
    if (color.equals("red")) {  
      System.out.println("Color is Red");  
    } else if (color.equals("green")) {  
      System.out.println("Color is Green");  
    } else {  
      System.out.println("Color not found");  
    } 


Current Version:

String color = "red";  
   
 switch (color) {  
 case "red":  
   System.out.println("Color is Red");  
   break;  
case "green":  
  System.out.println("Color is Green");  
   break;  
 default:  
     System.out.println("Color not found");  
 }
